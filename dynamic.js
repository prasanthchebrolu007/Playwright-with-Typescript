// JavaScript is known as dynamically typed because the type of a variable can change as the program runs. 
// Example:
// Imagine you have a box (variable) that can hold anything. One moment, it can hold a toy car (number), and the next moment, it can hold a teddy bear (string).

// In JavaScript, you can do this:

// javascript
// 
// let box = 5;    // The box holds the number 5
// box = "hello";  // Now the box holds the word "hello"
// In this example, the box can change what it holds without any problems, showing that JavaScript doesn't care about the type until you use it.
